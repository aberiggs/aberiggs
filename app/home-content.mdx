#### About

I'm a software engineer at [Adobe](https://adobe.com), where I work on productizing video research and bringing cutting-edge technology to creative professionals. 

Before Adobe, I studied Computer Science at Purdue University and worked on projects ranging from medical device software to robotics kernels. When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with film photography, wrenching on cars, or playing games with friends.

I occasionally write about my projects, interesting problems I've solved, and things I'm learning along the way.
